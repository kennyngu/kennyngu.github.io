                    <p>I was talking to my best friend and roommate, Anthony, towards the end of the semester (April 2018). </p>

                    <blockquote>Hey what’s next do you think? You’d probably think we’d or <br>
                                at the very least, I, would be more excited to graduate and move on with life.”</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>You know… I think the only next big magical step in our lives that can’t replicated is the day
                                all our kids get to meet each other. I’m really looking forward to that day.</blockquote>

                    <p>Anthony being huge factor in my emotional and mental growth, also introduced to me the idea that time is finite. 
                        Bringing me to the concept that <b>every</b> <i>single</i> person in the world is operating on a finite timeline, each one beginning with birth and ending at death. 
                        It’s been a full 18 years that I’ve been in school, from pre-school all the way through to the fourth and final year of undergrad. 
                        Each school year similar to the previous, starting out with excitement to see familiar faces and refreshing routines… 
                        until we build up an overwhelming impatience for summer to start again.
                        </p>

                    <p>The idea of summer to me, and like many other students, is a 3-month grace period where we get to do as we please. 
                        Work on ourselves, relax under the sun, hang out with friends and family, or sleep in until our parents scold us awake. 
                        Then we look forward to the first day of school when we’re able to catch up with friends and tell them about what you did over summer. 
                        It’s exciting, it’s fun, but it’s ever so fleeting.
                        </p>
                    <p>A lot of me looked forward to both the start and end of every summer because of the experience and 
                        positive feelings that came with returning to school. The magic of it all? It was replicated every single year. 
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How was your summer?</h2>
                    <blockquote>
                        What'd you do? Where'd you work again?
                        </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        Let's go out for a drink this weekend! 
                        </blockquote>

                    <p>Everyone is back! Everyone has cool stories to tell, awesome people they’ve met, interesting places they’ve visited, 
                        infatuated summer romances, or a fat paycheck to blow on stupid shit. 
                        </p>

                    <p>
                            In the past three summers I worked three different internships. I did it for career growth and experience as much as I did it for the money. 
                            Money to go out to eat, attend music festivals, spend on spontaneous activities, and enjoy life... 
                            <i>with your friends</i> on unstructured, flexible schedules. 
                            I’d skip class to grab lunch with friends or yell “C’s get degrees” as I pound down shots on a Thursday night or 
                            recklessly sneak into the Shrine for Dillon Francis and Flosstradamus two nights in a row for the hell of it. 
                            But that’s because we could… we were allowed to and we let ourselves be the adventurous kids that we <i>always</i> were. 
                            But what does it take to turn <i>were</i> into <i>are</i>? And when does time catch up to our inability to remain our joyous, youthful selves?
                        </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Just a Little Cliche</h2>

                    <p>
                            The past tense only takes precedence over the present when we let it go. 
                            Time catches up the moment we let it catch up. 
                            I run pretty fast so to the demise of many Outside Lands security guards and to my luck, 
                            I’m spending a lot of time looking in the rearview mirror at the responsibilities that come with adulthood. 
                        </p>

                    <p>
                            What I figured was, it takes a shift in mentality so I could look at my toes to see what’s in directly in front of me when I take my next step. 
                            Let my subconscious, sixth sense, and tingly-feelings guide me on the path I walk on. 
                            With time in mind, the stretch of life that I’m currently walking is the part that succeeds college graduation, 
                            it’s the part where I keep running because I just won.

                        </p>
                    
                    <p>This summer is the break between life stages. 
                        Many people travel and glow up their gram, some continue their studies, and others like to go straight to the workforce. 
                        I’m a little lucky because I have time to reflect on everything that’s happened in my life thus far. 
                        I’m taking this last opportunity to look back on the best parts of my 22-year-old life and enjoy each individual aspect of it.
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What are you doing this summer?</h2>

                    <p>With age, time, and growth, one thing I can’t do when I’m older, is be younger. 
                        I’m taking the opportunity to enjoy my youth and literally do nothing or anything. 
                        I can travel, make money, save money, and experience new things the rest of my life. 
                        Sometimes you’ll only have one chance to do specific things before it gets a little weird. 
                        This summer for me is the one opportunity I have to be a carefree, spontaneous 22-year-old and one of the 
                        last chances I’ll have to do things I never got to do as a <i>kid</i>. 
                        When I’m older I’ll only have stories of my past, not tales of revisiting it.
                        </p>

                    <p>Time is a straight path and we’ve been running a circular lap this entire time.
                        </p>
                    
                    <p>Homage to Drake’s new album. You only live once, so enjoy it.
                        </p>
